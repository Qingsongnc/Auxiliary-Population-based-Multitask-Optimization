## 1.Content list

- APMTO -The code of APMTO;
- AEMTO -The reproduced code of AEMTO;
- OTMTO -The reproduced code of OTMTO;
- The random seeds for 30 runs of all the algorithms;
- data -The raw numerical output for APMTO and all the 6 compared algorithms;
- seed -The random seeds for APMTO, AEMTO, and OTMTO.
- WilcoxonRankSumTest -The code of the Wilcoxon's rank-sum test;
- ConvergenceCurve -The code to generate the convergence curves;
- README.md -The instruction file.

## 2.The acquisition of the experimental results

Herein, we have offered the code of our APMTO and the reproduced codes of AEMTO and OTMTO. The codes of the three algorithms are all organized with the same structure. By running the main.py file, the algorithms will run for 30 times on all the problems in CEC2022 test suite.
